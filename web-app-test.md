**Sample script:** (for both methods)
Every now and then I like to compare my old art and the art I make currently to see if I’m improving, and also critic myself and find areas in my art I can improve on and get better. But it’s usually difficult organizing every drawing together and putting side by side on the same page so i reached out to the heavens for help and the art gods blessed me with milanote, the sponsor of today’s video. Milanote is an interactive tool that helps you organize all the different files for your CREATIVE projects on one platform so accessing them can be easier. Milanote allows you to collect and organize pictures, videos, notes and text, and arrange them into different boards using any of their built in templates that make it easy to start off your creative projects. You can also create several tasks for different things you want to study, and tick them when you’re done. For this instance, I’ll start by creating a general board where I’ll layout a broad overview that covers everything concerning the project I’m about to work on. next I’ll move on to place my references in a sub board and place my old art and current art in separate boards so I know where to find each of them. Then I create a new board where I place both drawings side by side so I can compare them, and also make notes on things I want to improve on or change. I like to use milanote’s web clipper tool when gathering screenshots from other artists that draw in a style I admire, and then save every image or screenshot I find useful In the board. 
 This also works well when you’re collaborating with other artists and working on the same project, so everyone has a good understanding of what the project is about and has access to the same references all at once since everything is properly organized in the same place.

### Testing method 1:

**Creative brief:**
Brand Safety Guidelines
Milanote does not sponsor video content that includes any of the following:
- Explicit adult themes, language, or imagery
- Polarising political topics
- Personal attacks or targeted harassment
- Unverified theories presented as facts

Script flow:
1. Introduce sponsorship
2. Describe what Milanote is
3. Describe how your audience could use Milanote
4. Describe how you use Milanote
5. Describe how to collaborate and share work
6. Call to action

What to avoid in your script:
- **Mentioning YouTube Planning:** Since many viewers may not be YouTubers, discussing how you use Milanote for YouTube content planning may not be relatable; such as YouTube thumbnail, title, and posting schedule. Instead, discuss how it helps you as a content creator with your filmmaking, writing process, and research planning.
- **Neglecting an Introduction:** Avoid diving straight into your project without first explaining what Milanote is. Briefly describe “Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.”
- **Sign-Up Instructions:** Refrain from mentioning 'downloading' Milanote. Instead, direct users to 'sign up for free.'
- **Forgetting Call to Action:** Remember to encourage your viewers to sign up using the link in the description.

Hey Elizabeth, 

Your direction with the script is absolutely perfect and the example you have given for your screen recording voiceover sounds great! 

Just a reminder to make sure that you explain Milanote's features by interacting with and explaining your room makeover project because keeping in mind that your integration is 5 minutes long, sometimes it can sound like a Milanote tutorial :)

Please feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are our top tips for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click in on the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief for more reference. Looking forward to seeing this come to life soon and thanks for all your amazing work so far!! 

Best, Himika

Thanks so much for sharing your script! This sounds fantastic. One small thought I had was to suggest how your audience would use Milanote and why it would bring them value, i.e. if they are a artist and have a art project they need to plan, gathering inspiration from the web, collecting references of other artist work, or making a moodboard is all possible within Milanote. You're welcome to start drafting your video. Looking forward to seeing it soon! Many thanks, Bella
